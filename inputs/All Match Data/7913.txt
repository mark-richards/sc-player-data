#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Perkins roves a Wright contest and grubbers a goal from 20m in the pocket. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Rayner passes to McCluggage 40m out on the flank. Shooting for a rare goal haul of three... it's good! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Ah but a review shows it was touched off the boot&#044; party pooper. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: From the resultant ball in it's Neale again to snap some garbage with three Dons around him from 25m in the pocket&#044; he deserves all six votes! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Daniher leaps over a big pack 40m out on the flank to catch a Neale kick&#044; reaching out to his right in ungainly but skilful fashion.

Parish just misses to the right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: After Guelfi strips Zorko of the footy in the centre&#044; Francis gives to Cutler who can settle over a running snap from 25m on the flank&#044; he steers that one through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Neale passes to Cameron 45m out on the flank who misses everything. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:52)</span><br />
