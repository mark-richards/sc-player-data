#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: The McCluggage kick from the hotspot was called a goal by the goal umpire and is not overturned on review&#044; that's the ball game! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Houli turns the ball over at half back&#044; Robinson grubs the repeat inside 50&#044; it's McCluggage who gets the chance&#044; he's missed do many but this one sails through! But a review... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Balta kicks up the guts&#044; Lyons puts it back in and Astbury is pinged for a block on Stefan Martin 40m out... who plays on for some reason and no score results. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Zorko receives from McInerney and  gets the inside 50 kick after the next centre bounce and it's Hipwood who marks in front of Astbury 45m out on a slight angle.

Two kicks in it&#044; 4:08 to play. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Clock under 5:00 and it's all ahead of Richmond&#044; their goals are not coming easily and they need three more. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Prestia catches Hipwood baulking near the hotspot to prevent a Brisbane score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: After review&#044; the best goal of the year is reversed as the ball snicked the padding of the post on the way through! Huge moment! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Long ball to the Richmond FP&#044; Bolton beats Rich to the fall then delivers a lovely left foot step for a snap from the boundary 25m out... rolls end over end for a... what? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bolton clears from a scrimmage in the centre to Dustin Martin contesting with Andrews on the HFF&#044; both go to ground but Dusty recovers first to gather and... snap OOTF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:44)</span><br />
