#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Melbourne win the minor premiership and have an epic comeback. Home final for the best team of the home and away season&#044; seconds away from coming third.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lever receives the deliberate out of bounds and then the 50-metre penalty. He drives long and Gawn takes the clunk. Shooting post siren from 25&#044; Max goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 40 seconds left. Ball-up&#044; 70 metres out from the Dees attacking goal.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 47 seconds left. Boundary throw-in.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 1:10 left to play. Dees hold the ball on the centre wing. Cats by two points.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Geelong go long from the resultant centre bounce and Dahlhaus is the one at the end of the chain. He flings a shot from 40 on the slight&#044; missing to the left-hand side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pickett paces off the wing and sends long to the Fritsch&#044; Bailey getting out the back of Henry. He gathers the loose ball and sends it through from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron leads out ahead of Petty and the former Giant takes the strong grab. Shooting from 40 out on the sharp angle&#044; he sends his effort into the post.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Melbourne is unstoppable out of the middle once again. They drive forward through Gawn and Spargo gathers the crumbs off the four-strong pack. Charlie hammers the snap from 20! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Three in a row to start the quarter for the travellers! Oliver receives deep in the forward pocket from Viney&#044; setting himself and sending through his second with the snap! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:22)</span><br />
