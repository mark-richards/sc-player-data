#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: It's online but falls centimetres too short&#044; touched over the line! Blues get the win by a point! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A 50m penalty brings Saad from defence into the centre circle. He bombs it forward where Townsend swoops in to mark at 45. This to win it... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With 90 seconds on the clock&#044; Cunningham marks unopposed within scoring range. He struts in&#044; shoots from 40... and misses to the left. Bombers regain possession. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McGovern courageously marks a sky-high Setterfield kick just inside the 50 arc. His shot looks good off the boot but drops marginally short&#044; punched over for a handy point. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Scores are level as the gameplay clock ticks under five minutes remaining! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Murphy's hasty stoppage clearance falls into the lap of Levi. Replay indicates a potential dropped mark but the umpire was unsighted. The shot is straight through the middle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: After emerging from the stoppage on the wing&#044; Murphy pinpoints Martin within the forward arc. From 45&#044; directly in front&#044; the ex-Sun converts! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Bombers rebound quickly from half hack through Langford. McKernan then finds Fantasia within range who offloads to McDonald-Tipungwuti for the easy 15m running goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Plowman is penalised for holding Stringer's arm in the marking contest and Jake makes him pay from 25! Essendon move out to a one-goal lead to start the fourth. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Merrett dinks a short right-footed pass to Stringer who marks and splits the middle after the 3QT siren. Scores are level going into the final term! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br />
