#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Smith marks about 65m out on the flank and runs around with seconds remaining&#044; sending a rocket through the middle for some elite junk <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: The Dogs get on top at another throw-in through Bontempelli and Smith&#044; who tumbles it to the square. McComb manages to slide through and get a boot on it before it's rushed over! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Rosas taps down to Ainsworth who tries to snap at goal but misses horribly! 70 seconds left and that might be it <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Stoppage 60m out from the Suns goal. 1:24 left <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: The Suns burst from defence through Casboult and Swallow&#044; the ball is kicked to the advantage of Rosas who runs on and kicks a goal! 90 seconds left and 7 points in it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: The Suns can't get a clean mark and the ball spills to Naughton who handpasses to Williams who snaps quickly and goals to likely put the Suns to bed! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Treloar attempts a running snap after finding space but kicks it OOTF <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: The ball somehow stays in play on the wing and the Suns move it forward&#044; Rosas spots Ellis who marks 20m out in front. He puts it through the middle and it's back to 7 points! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Chol stands well above the Dogs defence and takes a good mark 35m out. The kick looks good&#044; but it fades very late and goes through for a behind <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Rankine ducks&#044; dodges and weaves&#044; dishing off to Ellis and gets it back before shaking off his opponent and kicking a brilliant goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:46)</span><br />
