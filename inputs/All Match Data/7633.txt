#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ward and Kelly link through the stoppage&#044; enabling Josh to pace away unopposed. He settles on the shot and hammers it through from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hill thuds the pass to the leading Finlayson&#044; Jeremy taking the grab at full pace. The left-footer shoots from 45 on the slight and nabs his fourth! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Giants grab one against the run of play! Himmelberg forces it forward&#044; Moore goes for the mark and drops it. That allows Kelly to swoop in and goal from point blank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Maynard&#044; Pendlebury and Thomas combine as the Pies swing it from the resultant stoppage to scoring range. Scott flicks to Josh&#044; who snaps truly with a 40-metre effort! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Sidebottom soccers the ball through for a rushed behind and the decision is duly awarded to the Giants. Finlayson shoots from the pocket and grabs the quick reply! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hoskin-Elliot&#044; against his former side&#044; chips the pass in short to the leading De Goey. The ball falls to ground&#044; Will promptly follows up and goals from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Giants snag one back against the play! Hill soccers out the back&#044; Himmelberg runs onto it and Harry sends it through from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cox sells an incredibly bit of candy&#044; sending the crowd apocalyptic. Mason sends it long and Hoskin-Elliott receives the free in the marking contest. He converts from the pocket! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 23:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: A five-strong pack emerges and Cox is the one to bring it to ground level&#044; following the Sidebottom bomb. Daicos gathers off ground level and snaps from 35 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 20:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Adams produces an excellent tackle at the hot spot. Taranto haphazardously flicks the ball to ground. De Goey pounces and snaps truly from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 15:26)</span><br />
