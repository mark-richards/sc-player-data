#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: De Goey gathers in the pocket&#044; his man Kolodjashnij goes to ground so he runs into the open goal for his fifth. Pie fans in the crowd start chanting! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Grundy down to Crisp for the centre clearance up the guts&#044; De Goey marks 20m out in front of Kolodjashnij and boots goal number four. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Guthrie marks 40m out in the corridor and sails through a goal&#044; 2:15 to go and two kicks in it but it looks exceedingly unlikely. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: De Goey passes to Mihocek 45m out on the flank after Treloar found him in an acre of space on the wing. Mihocek hits the square&#044; rushed behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Blicavs drops a relieving mark in the BP&#044; from the resultant throw in De Goey volleys his third and surely the sealer in this low-scoring game. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hoskin-Elliott uses Kolodjashnij as a stepladder to take a huge hanger from a Pendlebury pass 20m out on the flank&#044; he plays on and misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Dangerfield spoils on the wing and taps the crumb to Hawkins who hits Rohan 40m out on a slight angle&#044; who delivers a lovely finish. Cats well back in it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Simpson goals from a free kick 20m out in front. Geelong are somehow still in this despite being largely outplayed for most of it&#044; and are now two down again. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 18:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Treloar hoofs a snap wide from a stoppage 20m out in the pocket. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 15:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bews flies over two Pies in the square to touch through a long Stephenson snap for a point. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 14:12)</span><br />
