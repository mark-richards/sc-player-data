He shoots from 40 on the flank&#044; missing to the near side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Tigers win it from the resultant centre clearance and the pill is sent to the isolated Rivers/Aarts matchup. Jake clunks the grab and misses the shot from 45.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Oliver goes long to the arc. Petracca reads it off hands at full pace. He sidesteps Astbury and snaps it through from 35 with absolute class! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:18)</span><br />
