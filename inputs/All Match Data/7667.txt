#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hall&#044; McKay and Thomas combine with driving kicks through the middle of Marvel Stadium. Thomas receives and Zurhaar is the final link in the chain&#044; finishing truly! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Davies-Uniacke intercepts the Grundy rebound. Luke darts the pill in and finds Mahony on the short pass. Jack lines up from the paint of the arc and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mihocek finds De Goey on the lead and the Roos give up another 50-metre penalty after Walker ran through the mark. De Goey nails his sixth from point blank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Zurhaar takes a specky and then it appears as though it was called play on. It's a bizarre moment&#044; ending in a minor score from 40.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Campbell and Menadue combine by hand before Connor finds Goldstein within scoring range. Todd centres to Young. The former Bulldog shoots from outside the arc&#044; minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Goldstein receives the free for illegal contact in the marking contest. The ruckmen lines up from 35 on the slight&#044; missing poorly to the right-hand side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: For taking his legs out. Darcy duly converts truly from point-blank range&#044; his third for the day! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McKay makes a horrible error in the goal square&#044; letting the ball bounce through his legs. Ziebell makes a desperate effort at the ball&#044; but Cameron receives the free... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Campbell assesses the options&#044; catches the Zurhaar lead and places it on his chest. Cameron shoots from 45 on the slight and sends through the first of the fourth term! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cameron has his chance once more&#044; Maynard whacks to the seven-strong pack and Darcy pulls it down. He shoots from 35 on the slight and sends that one through on the siren! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br />
