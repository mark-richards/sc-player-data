The former Docker sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lloyd bodies the ball&#044; runs through Markov and moves the ball further afield. Papley receives and dabs to McLean&#044; Hayden marking at the top of the square. He finishes truly! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Burgess knocks down for Greenwood from the forward fifty boundary throw-in.

Swallow takes the shot&#044; missing from 45. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Kennedy darts to the leading Sinclair and the pass is picture perfect. The former Eagle wastes little time&#044; finding Hayward on the hard lead. Will nails it from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Errant handball by the pressured Florent and Anderson swoops in to mop up.
