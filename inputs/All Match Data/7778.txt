#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Macrae misses with a rebound kick that goes straight to Draper&#044; that's the ball game. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Stringer roves the resultant throw in and kicks to the square&#044; Dogs rush it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Wright intercepts a Daniel centring ball 55m out in the corridor. He takes his full allotment of time then kicks deep for no score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Redman's chaos ball towards the top of the square ricochets off Daniels' shin for a point. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 3:12 to go and two kicks in it&#044; this would be a thieving of the highest order! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bontempelli barges through a pack at half forward&#044; drops it and gets a holding free on Shiel 45m out on a slight angle. Captain's goal is good. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 4:09 to go and three kicks in it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bruce takes a big grab in front of a pack 15m out&#044; he rushes the set shot and pops it through. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hind pushes Scott in the back as they chase a crumb on the boundary 25m out&#044; Scott screws through the free kick for a behind near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Durham passes to Wright 50m out on a slight angle to mark in front of Duryea following the next centre bounce. This for seven big ones... another long strong diamond from 2MP! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:48)</span><br />
