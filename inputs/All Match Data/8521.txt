#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Stengle hits Rohan leading to the boundary 40m out&#044; nothing Hibberd could do there. Chucky can't score in the last minute&#044; but he deserves BOG after KOing his teammate Jezza. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 33:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Fritsch is over the back of Kolodjashnij to mark and goal at the top of the square from a long Petracca kick&#044; but with 1:13 to go it's too late. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Pickett has a snap from a stoppage in the pocket touched through by Stewart. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Petracca roves a Petty contest in the pocket and threads a drop punt off a step from 20m. Crowd gives him nothing&#044; 6:12 to go&#044; still four kicks in it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Oliver Henry feeds Bruhn who puts a left-foot step on Viney for another one from near the hotspot. Rohan involved again. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: After that burst by Geelong this game is just about in junk time now&#044; amazingly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Gawn down to Petracca at a ball-in to the pocket 20m out but the left-foot snap is wide left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Another rebound around the wing&#044; Stengle feeds Duncan who skids through another from 50m on a slight angle&#044; the Cats are on FIYAH! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Miers and then Close tackle Demons without the footy but ump says play on in a wet game&#044; Rohan burns off May to race into the open goal on the fast break! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: That goal was started by Atkins' pressure to worry Fritsch off a snap at half back to start the chain. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:05)</span><br />
