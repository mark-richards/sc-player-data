#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: McCluggage roves at half forward and feeds Daniher who blazes wide from near true CHF but only five seconds left at the kick in... long bomb but siren blows&#044; Lions hang on! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Serong again with the clearance&#044; Brayshaw crumbs at half forward but the Lions repel&#044; Hipwood takes a link mark on the wing and starts more tempo... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Jackson to Serong at the bounce but Daniher locks him up&#044; secondary stoppage. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 1:09 to play and Fremantle's season requires a winner. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Switkowski gives wide to Frederick on his own near the boundary 35m out after Freo gets a rebound through Ryan and Henry&#044; Freddie checksides a huge goal off the right! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Freo almost get a rebound up the corridor but Switkowski misses Jackson with a handball and the Lions mop up to play some tempo. Clock ticks to 2:00 to go. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Robertson involved twice on that play after pulling off the green vest with five minutes to go. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Cameron plays on to advantage from a HTB free to McCarthy on Henry on the HFF for a centring ball to Hipwood at the hotspot. The Eel kicks truly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Sturt marks in front of Starcevich near the boundary 40m out&#044; his radar has been on today and he threads a sensational drop punt! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Gunston has position on Ryan and bodies him away from the fall of a McCluggage pass from the HFF to the corridor 20m out. This would break a run of lead changes... it's good! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:23)</span><br />
