#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Taranto marks in front of Williams 40m out on a slight angle in the last minute&#044; deserves a fourth goal even if it is in junk time... gets it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Like Damien Hardwick&#044; the old Tigers have had just about enough of this game. Clock under 3:00 and three kicks in it&#044; Port is home. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Slippery conditions today have had the players looking like rhinos on rollerskates at times&#044; and the Tigers haven't had things sliding their way today. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Taranto spins after receiving at the hotspot and snaps for his fourth goal&#044; McKenzie dives on the line to touch it through&#044; review shows he got a fingernail on it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Balta is pinged for contact over the shoulder on Horne-Francis near the hotspot&#044; Tiger fans chunter but it was there albeit soft.

Strong rain falling&#044; as it has at times throughout the game. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:42)</span><br />
