,,,,,,,,#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Perryman sizes up his fifth goal with an outside-50 set shot but it's OOTF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Daniels crumbs and pops it over the top to Toby Greene&#044; running back with the flight to the goalsquare. His connection isn't pretty&#044; but he gets the intended result nevertheless.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Giants provide the quick reply thanks to good bodywork from Tom Green&#044; setting up a sizzling snap and a fourth goal for Harry Perryman. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: O'Connor floats in to mark the sky-high Ratugolea entry. Davis gives him a late slap on the noggin&#044; gifting a 50m penalty and a sure-thing goal.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hawkins and Clark combine a couple of times&#044; resulting in an Ablett set shot from 45. It's straight through the middle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Taylor gets the one-two with Ablett before poking a short pass to Hawkins on the lead. Tom goes back from 45 and hits it flush.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Out of congestion&#044; Finlayson gets a hurried kick away that lands right in the lap of Toby Greene who snuck out the back. It's an easy goal&#044; extending the lead to 38. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With space to run and jump&#044; Cameron marks the high Haynes entry&#044; lines up&#044; and slots it from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 0:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lloyd launches a high footy that forces the under-pressure Blicavs to concede the rushed behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 21:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Greene shrugs the Selwood tackle and finds Cameron in the pocket with a classy outside-of-the-boot pass. Jeremy nails the left-foot snap. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 19:29)</span><br />
