#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Berry launches long to the isolated contest between Murphy and Cameron. Charlie outmanoeuvres his opponent&#044; getting to the drop zone and taking the mark. He kicks his sixth! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Thomas takes the mark&#044; 45-metres out on the flank&#044; as we tick out the final two minutes of this affair. Josh sends through the consolation prize! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ginnivan throws ball to boot from 35 on the slight&#044; under immense pressure. The promising youngster sends to the left-hand side&#044; the first minor of his fleeting career.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Daniher and Roughead battle in the isolated contest&#044; Joe taking a screamer over the former Bulldog. He bounces to his feet and centres to the unmarked Neale. Lachie misses from 30. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cockatoo makes it two in a minute for the Lions. From the resulting centre bounce&#044; Brisbane stroke forward through Bailey. Nakia gathers the crumbs and snaps truly from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bailey dabs the short pass to Lyons&#044; catching the Magpies defence unawares once more. Jarryd lines up from a step beyond the arc&#044; sending it through for his first! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mihocek is held in the marking contest and the free is duly paid. Brodie lines up from a step within the arc&#044; missing poorly to the right-hand side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Elliott marks within scoring range&#044; lowers the eyes and finds Cameron unguarded&#044; 45 out from goal. The former Swan lines up on the slight angle and makes no mistake! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Lions start the fourth much like they ended the third. Cameron beats out Maynard in the isolated contest&#044; weaves around the desperate Brayden and goals from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Zorko releases Neale as the home side surge from the resultant centre bounce. Lachie unleashes from 35 and misses to the right-hand side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 31:22)</span><br />
