#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Free against Melksham to Howard on the HBF&#044; mark Kent on the wing&#044; switches to midfield... siren!

Membrey kicks the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: That kick was heading for the behinds but took a wicked off break&#044; almost Angus Monfries areas&#044; for a huge score! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Petracca is spoiled 35m out&#044; gets tackled&#044; wins his own crumb and gets a snap off that rolls tantalisingly... did Howard get a finger on it on the line? Umpire's call: goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Zero goalmouth action so far in Q4&#044; both half back lines able to intercept at will but unable to get decent attacks going. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:19)</span><br />
