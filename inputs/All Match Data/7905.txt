#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: BLakey kicks high and blind from a stoppage to 45m on the flank where O'Halloran marks and misses. Less than two minutes to go&#044; game over. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Florent runs from the next centre bounce and gives to Gulden who passes to the man of the moment&#044; Franklin. Buddy lines up from 45m on a slight angle but hooks it right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Ward bounces through a goal from a stoppage 30m out on the flank&#044; despite a lunge on the line by Campbell. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Kennedy turns the ball over by hand in the centre&#044; Taranto marks a Brander pass at the hotspot and misses. That was probably the last chance. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Brander rolls a snap wide from mid-range. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hopper holds Florent at a stoppage 30m out near the boundary&#044; the free kick is straight through for the third goal for Florent&#044; Sydney in control now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Flynn gets a rather soft holding free on Tom McCartin in a marking contest 45m out on a slight angle. The Swans fans cheer as the set shot flies OOTF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Coniglio set Hill away to run to 45m on a slight angle and shoot... just wide right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hickey taps a ground ball wide of a stoppage in the pocket towards the corridor&#044; Heeney is first there to gather and snap over his left shoulder for another one for Sydney! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Flynn roves on his knees on the HFF and gives wide to Taranto who runs to 40m on the boundary and snaps OOTF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:52)</span><br />
