#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Switkowski zips around in the pocket and finds a kick back to Schultz 35m out. He jogs in to kick from 40 and gets a consolation goal <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Lobb tries to pinch a late goal but just barely misses <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Duryea blasts a kick towards the boundary out of defence and is pinged for deliberate. Henry gets the ball and kicks inside to the pocket where Jackson marks and hits the post <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Ryan is caught napping by Naughton in defence as he's brought down in a strong tackle 40m out in front of goal. Naughton slots his second goal as it's party time under the roof! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Ugle-Hagan kicks across half-forward and Dale roams up to mark 45m out.

It's a peach of a kick as he keeps Freo alive with his fourth goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Smith kicks wide to the flank and Ugle-Hagan&#044; who then kicks to McNeil 25m out from goal. He slots the goal and it might just be a bridge too far for the Dockers now <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Schultz is under immense pressure as he tries to get Freo back in the game with a snap&#044; but misses everything <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Hughes is caught in a double West/Macrae tackle&#044; and Macrae wins the free kick. The silky-smooth operator makes no mistake as the Western Bulldogs have smashes the game open! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Naughton sets it up to the square but it's tapped over solidly by Cox <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:17)</span><br />
