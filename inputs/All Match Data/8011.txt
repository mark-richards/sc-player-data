#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Josh Daicos bounces a kick from a stoppage at half forward for Elliott to gather and kick a junk time special&#044; his third. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Josh Daicos feeds Crisp to run to 40m on a slight angle and ram through the official sealer! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Ben Brown marks a Viney pass 30m out on a slight angle and plays on but screws it wide&#044; hurrying as he knew the clock was against him. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 4:19 to go and three kicks in it now&#044; by all rights that should be the sealer. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Lipinski roves at the hotspot&#044; turns onto his right&#044; his snap falls in the square where Mihocek marks over Petty for his fourth goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Harmes gives to Viney who runs through the HFF to 45m and shoots just before two Pies sandwich him&#044; kick falls on the line to be rushed. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 6:42 to go and Collingwood are a couple of kicks in front now&#044; really should hold on from here but the Demons are a champion side and could pull this out with stars standing up. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hoskin-Elliott wheels and goes after marking on the HFF&#044; his kick is a beauty to the advantage of Henry in front of Lever 35m out on a slight angle. Henry converts. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Jackson juggles a long ball by Jordon to the pocket over Howe for a contested grab. He lines up from 20m and slots it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: The much vaunted Melbourne defensive structure is looking a bit shaky with no May&#044; Turner subbed off and Petty not 100% either. Pies +6 clearances also a big stat. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:54)</span><br />
