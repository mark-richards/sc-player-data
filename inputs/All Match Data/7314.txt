#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McHenry marks inside the arc after receiving the pass from McAsey. The first gamer shoots with less than a minute to play and the first gamer misses to the right hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Make that another for the rampant Power. Westhoff receives the free from 40 out&#044; directly in front and slams home another! This'll live long in the memory for the teal faithful! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The forward 50 throw in allows Dixon to demonstrate his part time trade. He shoves Walker out the way&#044; takes the pill and snaps it through from 40!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dixon and Talia fly at the goal mouth via the Marshall punt. The former Sun gets his frame in front and clunks the grab. Charlie heads back and sends through his second! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ebert&#044; Gray and Duursma link by foot as the Power charge from the wing to scoring range. The second year player lines up for his fourth from 40 and he misses to the right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith has the ball on the wing and gazes afield for options. He settles on the darting pass to Crouch&#044; of the Brad variety. He marks and goals from 40 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Marshall launches deep from CHF and Duursma is the surprising floater in from the side&#044; taking the strong chest mark. Xavier goes back&#044; lines up and kicks his third! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Crows surge forward from the kick in and Crocker takes the mark out the back. The former Magpie shoots the set shot and goals from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 23:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Boak launches to the hot spot and Westhoff pulls down the grab. He wastes little time&#044; flicking to the pacing Gray. Robbie strolls to the goal mouth and incredibly hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lycett&#044; Motlop&#044; Boak and back again to the speeding former Cat. He kicks to the unmarked Westhoff and the veteran marks ahead of the trundling O'Brien. Justin goals from 20! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 18:16)</span><br />
