#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Fritsch marks on a lead 40m out in front to put a cherry on top of this team performance&#044; but perhaps fittingly&#044; he misses <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Weideman marks by himself in the square and slots his 4th in junk time <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: The ball is sent into the square in the Wright direction&#044; but May sends the ball over <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Viney pumps it long to Fritsch&#044; who makes a meal of the mark.

The ball spills and Fritsch mops up the mess with a neat finish <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Petracca ends up 1 on 1 inside 50&#044; picks up the ball and fancies a dribble kick from 35m out on the boundary.
