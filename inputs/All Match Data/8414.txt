He puts through another goal to put a cherry on top of a great team performance! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Crozier gets a free kick and rare set shot on the 50m arc&#044; but he blows it wide for a point <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Owens hangs on to a triple-grabber 25m out in front&#044; and steers home his third goal as it's party time under the roof! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Marshall is unopposed on the line&#044; and able to tap through an Ugle-Hagan set shot <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Crouch bombs it from 50m out on the run&#044; it falls short and a comedic shuffle ensues between Crozier and Butler&#044; but it eventually rolls over for a point <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Wood tries to sneak a goal from the contest&#044; but it thuds into the post <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Hill gets loose down the forward flank and spies Wood on the lead in the middle of the forward 50.

His set shot is more of a set shank however&#044; as he misses to the right <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Baker runs past and gets the ball from Mclean 50m out&#044; but his kick is wide <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 28:32)</span><br />
