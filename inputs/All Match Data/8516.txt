#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: And yes&#044; the margin is going to stay as it has most of the second half&#044; Brisbane dominating everywhere except the scoreboard to but doing enough to win. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Warner plays on to advantage from a Gulden free on Lester on the wing&#044; he goes long to the square but Starcevich rushes over Hayward. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Cameron rises in front of Cunningham and clunks a Rayner pass 40m out in front&#044; his face full of relief as he has had an almost night up to now. Charlie tugs it left&#044; though. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: McInerney passes to Hayward 40m out on a slight angle after a chaotic and risky rebound by Sydney. Wilbur shanks it right for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bailey runs from the next bounce and goes long&#044; off hands for a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 5:49 left and three goals the difference. Technically it's a game but really it's not. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Gulden steers through a snap from 45m on the flank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Lohmann passes to Robertson 20m out on a slight angle&#044; he kicks the first goal of official junk time. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Parker snaps a lovely goal from a throw in to 30m on the flank. He has been Sydney's best on the day. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: The Lions have a convoy running from a stoppage at CHB&#044; Bailey kicks on the burst from 55m and it skids through. That has been coming for a long time. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:15)</span><br />
