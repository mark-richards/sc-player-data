#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: An incredible comeback in Robert Harvey's first match as senior coach! The Pies surge home to win by 16 points&#044; down by as much as 29 points in the third term.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pendlebury pounces away from the centre bounce once more&#044; this time finding Henry&#044; Oliver taking a strong contested grab. He shoots from beyond the arc&#044; missing to the right.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Madgen launches to the hot spot and the five-strong pack converges. Thomas gathers at ground level and flogs it home for close range&#044; sealing the match for the Pies! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 4:28 left to play. The Pies lead by nine points&#044; the next centre bounce is crucial&#044; a space the black and white have been dominant at.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Madgen misfires with the handball&#044; sending it directly to Martin who&#044; in turn&#044; found an unguarded Lynch. Tom sends through the major from 40 out! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Tigers have simply no answer&#044; this is incredible to watch. Seven in a row for the Pies&#044; in the matter of moments! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pendlebury charges through with the clearance win once more&#044; this time finding Mihocek on the lead. Brodie sets it to the top of the square and finds Grundy. The ruckmen goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: That is an incredible six in a row for the Pies! They lead by nine points with over eight minutes left to play.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Adams and Pendlebury link through the following centre bounce&#044; finding De Goey on the bounce within the arc. Jordan paces from Grimes and finds Murphy unguarded. Nathan goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Brown wins the ball out of the resultant centre bounce and Callum goes long to the isolated Garthwaite/De Goey matchup. Jordan takes the clunk and sends the Pies into the lead! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:46)</span><br />
