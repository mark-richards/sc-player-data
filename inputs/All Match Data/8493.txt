#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Ball locked inside Narrm's forward 50 as the clock stops on 12 seconds. Game over. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: 60 seconds left and the Dockers are milking every second they can across half back <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Grundy dumps it inside 50&#044; the Dockers look to get it out but Fritsch applies the pressure and Angus Brayshaw marks 40m out on an angle&#044; but he shanks it horribly for a point!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Walyalup set up the possession game as the clock winds down&#044; before Grundy wins it back and a 50m penalty is called against Jackson! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Brayshaw sends it inside 50 after a chaotic few seconds and Banfield marks it uncontested 20m out. He splits the middle and the margin is back to 8 with 150 seconds remaining! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Petracca smashes a ball out of congestion and it wobbles into the pocket where Pickett is inexplicably allowed to mark. He steadies himself and snaps it through! 2 points! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Melbourne slingshot down the wing through Spargo and Pickett&#044; Fritsch sends it inside 50 to Van Rooyen who marks all by himself 35m out&#044; but he misses to the right <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Pickett gets away from Walker again to mark on his chest 35m out&#044; but he fans the kick out right for a behind <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Sturt gets away with dropping the ball mid-May tackle&#044; Switkowski gathers and snaps from 5m out but can only manage a point <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Amiss mistimes his leap at the ball but recovers well to get the ball from Frederick and snap through a goal for a bit of breathing space for the Dockers! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Pickett finds Sparrow who's sprinted inside 50 to present an option. He takes his time and cuts the margin back to 3 points emphatically! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:43)</span><br />
