#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bruhn passes to Greene 40m out on a slight angle&#044; he plays on and boots goal number seven! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bontempelli feeds McNeil who snaps wide from 30m on a slight angle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Dunkley gets a free at a stoppage 30m out on the flank for Bruhn falling onto his back in a tackle. He kicks truly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 7:23 left and this is first time in a while the margin has been under four goals&#044; it's a shoot out so anything could happen. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Richards turns the ball over by hand at half back and the Giants are away around outer wing&#044; Riccardi is on the end of the Joe the Goose special for the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: West roves and swerves through heavy traffic near the hotspot but grubbers wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Greene beats  Gardner one out to mark a long Cumming kick to 20m in front&#044; he boots goal number six which is a personal best. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Macrae marks near the boundary 50m out&#044; high contact off the ball gifts him 50m and a charity goal. That's the official sealer&#044; if one was needed. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Brander pegs one back with a set shot from half forward. GWS is hanging in there but time is running out if they are to make a run at this margin of about four goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:06)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Liberatore runs away from the next centre bounce and goes long to Naughton who marks in front of Taylor 25m out on a slight angle for his fifth goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:12)</span><br />
