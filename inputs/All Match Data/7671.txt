#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Treloar gallops away from the centre bounds and sends it in the direction of Naughton. After being awarded the free for infringement&#044; Aaron hits the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Cripps brushes off the wimpy tackler and snaps a quality banana goal but it's too little&#044; too late. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bontempelli sends it to Lipinski in the goal square who steps around Newnes and kicks the easiest of majors. The fat lady's singing now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Fogarty manages a quick snap from the 35 but it barely makes it through for a minor score. Less than three minutes remaining now â the Blues need everything to go right from here.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Starting at HB&#044; the Dogs' chain of kicks results in Scott finding Bruce in the pocket. On the better side for a leftie&#044; he bends it through the middle!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:09)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: McNeil crumbs a huge hot-spot pack at full speed&#044; drawing the pressure before offloading by hand to Scott who kicks the goal and extends the Dogs' lead. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Johannisen reels and goes on the wing&#044; sending it to the advantage of Naughton who beats Parks in the one-on-one. From 35m on a slight angle&#044; Aaron puts the Dogs in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Dogs surge it forward from the wing. With desperate defence from a number of Blues and a key tackle from Fogarty&#044; it results in nothing more than a rushed behind.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Owies snap from heavy congestion in the hot spot but it's high and offline.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Libba sends a high&#044; floating footy from the wing inside 50 where Bruce wins the one on one with Weitering. His shot&#044; however&#044; is wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:36)</span><br />
