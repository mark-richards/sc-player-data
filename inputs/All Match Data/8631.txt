#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Byrne-Jones misses a long-range snap and looks as dejected as everyone in the stands&#044; except for the long-suffering GWS travelling fans. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Brown kicks very high from the HFF to Greene one out with Farrell&#044; Greene marks rather too easily on the chest 20m out on the flank&#044; Greene kicks the official sealer. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Repeat inside 50 for the Power&#044; Powell-Pepper gives to McEntee who blazes OOTF from 30m in the pocket. Just not happening for the teal army. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Port surges from the next bounce&#044; Wines goes short to Powell-Pepper 40m out on a slight angle. This has to go through... hoofed in ugly fashion to the right. Crowd silent. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: That was a quality finish from Riccardi&#044; he's earned a shoey. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: The Giants get a rebound going from half back to the fat side&#044; Cumming passes to the boundary for Riccardi to mark 40m out in front of Duursma. Goal umpire crouches... huge goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Q4 halfway done and it's as tight as a barracuda's ort. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Horne-Francis bursts inside from a throw in on the HFF but can't get the kick straight from 40m on a slight angle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Port's scoring opportunities are hardfought and low-percentage&#044; but they're the only ones who look like scoring. It's turned into an arm wrestle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Cumming snaps OOTF from behind a stoppage 45m out on the flank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:04)</span><br />
