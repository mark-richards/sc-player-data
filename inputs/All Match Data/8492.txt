#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Worpel clears high to the HFF&#044; Breust marks in front of Byrnes 40m out on a slight angle&#044; he kicks truly&#044; Hawks have pinched this game!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Gresham's centre clearance is a shank&#044; Sicily mops up and goes to the wing&#044; ball in with 1:06 to go. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 1:24 to go and the Hawks are in front. The highly unlikely has happened! Can it last? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: After a rebound switch started by Sicily&#044; Moore passes to Koschitzke to mark in front of Battle 40m out on a slight angle. Kosi for the lead... straight through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 3:12 to go and the Hawks are now down a couple of points. Stewards counting their interchanges with great interest. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Impey intercepts Byrnes' dump kick at half forward and goes long to the pocket over Stocker for Moore who plays on and snaps the goal from 15m! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hawks only two kicks behind with 5:20 to play&#044; still doable but they have not really looked like winners today despite having most of the play. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Nash marks over Webster on the HFF&#044; keeps his feet after the contest and goes quick and long to the square for Macdonald to mark over Stocker for the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Dan Butler has Higgins over the back for a simple goal but Higgins fluffs the easy mark&#044; Sicily arrives late to rush. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Lewis marks 50m out on a slight angle and just misses right. Hawks just have not converted well today. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:17)</span><br />
