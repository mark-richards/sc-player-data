#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: After Petracca misses a target by foot on the rebound&#044; Cavarra grubbers a goal from a pack in the pocket to settle the contest. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Weideman crumbs his own contest at the hotspot and gives Spargo a Joe the Goose special. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Fritsch takes a grab over titchy Daniel from an Oliver kick to the hotspot&#044; the wind skews the set shot wide left&#044; wicked swerve on that one. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Melksham passes to Hibberd running up from defence to 45m on a slight angle. Hibberd's set shot falls near the behind line&#044; Hannan roves but kicks OOTF under a tackle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Wallis marks 50m out on a slight angle but doesn't score&#044; predictably&#044; but he was just running down the clock as it's just about too late for the Dees now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Daniel gathers a loose ball in midfield&#044; crowded 50 to aim at and he has space so he runs to 40m on a slight angle and tries his luck... just a behind. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bontempelli sets up the next centre clearance and Wallis takes another contested grab at the hotspot for goal number four&#044; that is huge. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: McDonald marks and goals from 20m out in front&#044; Melbourne has the breeze in Q4 so they're not out of this if their midfield can find good deep targets. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hunter bounces a snap wide from half forward. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Goal confirmed. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:29)</span><br />
