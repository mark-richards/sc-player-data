#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Daniel pops a very short pass to Dale&#044; standing tall with Tarrant heaving on his heels. The shot from 45 is farside.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hall has a ping from outside 50 but it's just wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Zurhaar gets on the end of excellent clearance work from Simpkin&#044; pushing off Johannisen and bulleting the kick through the big sticks for a rare highlight. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A holding free kick is paid off the ball against McDonald&#044; gifting Bruce a look at his sixth. Bang in front&#044; 30 out&#044; Josh nails it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Dale lowers his eyes to hit Schache on the lead&#044; who goes back and slides it home from 40m&#044; directly in front as the margin drifts to 49 points. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Wallis finds space as he has on multiple occasions throughout the night&#044; juggling the grab in the pocket. His right-foot snap is straight through the middle!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Brown is able to outmark Wood but can't keep his 40m kick online&#044; fading to the left.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A chain of handballs ends with Johannisen on the HFF who puts on the afterburners but misses from 48. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Johannisen turns Simpkin before linking up (on his left) with the diving&#044; tumbling Wallis. The 40m shot is nearside and off-target. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Taylor shows courage as he flies to clunk the skyward Anderson entry kick over an equally high-flying Crozier.  From 40m&#044; directly in front&#044; it's straight through the middle. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:37)</span><br />
