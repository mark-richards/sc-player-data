#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McInerney wins it clean out the middle and the Lions waltz forward with ease. Daniher is the recipient of the speedy ball use&#044; marking and finishing truly from 20! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Make that another junk time goal for the Bombers! Stringer gets the pill 40 out and splits the middle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hooker takes the lead up mark and subsequently nails his fourth of the night from outside the arc! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Tom Berry kicks to the isolated contest between Cameron/Guelfi at the top of the square. Matt drops the attempted mark and Charlie goals from point-blank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ham goes out the back to the run of Tipungwuti. Anthony picks it up on the bounce and his snap from deep in the forward pocket misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bailey wins it at the hot spot and throws ball to boot without a second thought. His shot flies through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Heppell gifted a free to Robinson for holding. The Lions move it further afield at will&#044; and this time Hipwood is able to take advantage with a contested mark in the square. Goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Reid makes the handball error under tackle pressure&#044; releasing Zac Bailey. Bailey wastes little time&#044; finding Hipwood on the lead. Eric converts truly from 35! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 28:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McStay takes the mark as the Lions roar from the resultant centre stoppage. Dan flicks to Rich&#044; whose marauding effort misses from 55 to the left-hand side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hooker grabs the Bombers fourth against the run of play! Perkins and Jones combine&#044; sending it out the back where Cale takes his opportunity&#044; finishing truly from point-blank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:09)</span><br />
