#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Stephens is pinged for getting in the back of Giles-Langdon when tackling 20m out on a slight angle&#044; fairly unluckily. ZGL kicks some junk. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bell gathers a bouncing Papley ball in the pocket and snaps some garbage from 20m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Foot gives outside to Stephens who performs a checkside from 25m on a slight angle for some champagne footy. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hayward marks in front of Keeffe in a big pack in the square&#044; the mark is set on the behind line but he goals anyway. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Parker misses a set shot from the HFF. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Thurlow fumbles a ground ball and gets a free for Williams falling into his back&#044; he converts from 30m on a slight angle to ice the game&#044; though GWS haven't looked like it at all. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hutchesson roves and snaps wide from a stoppage 25m out in the pocket. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Finlayson flies over a pack next to the hotspot and clunks a Himmelberg ball after Melican gave away a free on the wing. He shanks the set shot as the 3QT siren sounds. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Papley flies and misses a Sinclair pass to CHF but it bounces off Shaw behind him&#044; he butters up and snaps from 45m on a slight angle under pressure.. just misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 21:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Shaw intercepts in midfield and the Giants counter up the guts&#044; Kelly tries his luck from 60m to an empty square but the ball skids wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 17:44)</span><br />
