#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Steele&#044; Clark and King combine as the Saints search for the shooting opportunity. Clark receives back from Max and hammers it through from deep in the forward pocket! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Cousins&#044; Hanrahan and Morrison all link before finding Breust unattended. Luke marks 30 from goal and wastes little time&#044; sending the consolation through with the snap! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Breust and Maginness combine out of defence and the second gamer launches the brown and gold forward. Hanrahan speeds out the back and soccers the pressured effort&#044; poster. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hardwick dobs the pill to Moore. The youngster receives without a soul in sight and the plucky forward takes the opportunity&#044; running his measure and nailing it from 40! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Butler goes long to Membrey and the former Swan clunks another&#044; unopposed after the Jiath turnover. Shooting from 25 on the slight&#044; Tim nails his second! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hill pounds through the resultant contest and launches to the isolated matchup between Higgins/Jiath. Jack gets a step and marks out the back&#044; who goals with ease! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hanrahan and Jiath combine through the middle and Oliver finds the lead of the Hawks skipper. McEvoy shoots from 45 on the flank and the former Saint dobs the major! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ross throws it on the boot from the chalk of 50 and misses to the left-hand side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wilkie and Jones combine before Marshall is found unmarked inside scoring range. Rowan chips further&#044; Butler marking unopposed. Dan sends through the snap from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: King bounds in and out of traffic&#044; pirouetting before sending boot to ball. The play was something out of ballet&#044; his resultant effort hitting the top of the post from 35. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:35)</span><br />
