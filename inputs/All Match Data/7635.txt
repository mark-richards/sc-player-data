#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Fritsch pounces on the loose ball in the pocket but the hasty&#044; left-boot snap flies the near side of the post.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: An under-pressure Miers takes a quick potshot at goal but it misses.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Inches away from a potential goal of the year&#044; Pickett hits the post with a 40-metre dribbler from the boundary. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A desperate Selwood soccers the footy off the turf from the pocket. Momentarily online&#044; it then narrowly skids the wrong side of the post.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Pickett nails Selwood HTB at half-back&#044; causing a chain reaction of Melbourne touches that results in Melksham kicking the easiest of goals from point-blank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Brayshaw takes the defensive mark unopposed&#044; however&#044; meanwhile&#044; Gawn is pinged for holding Stanley&#044; gifting the Cats an easy shot. Despite said ease&#044; Rhys sprays it wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A long bomb from Smith picks out Hawkins and Tomlinson in the one-on-one. Channeling his inner Tim Cahill&#044; Hawkins volleys the goal from the hotspot! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Zach Guthrie's defensive kick is intercepted by Petracca. Unfortunately for the Dees&#044; Melksham's right-foot snap bends too far to the right.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Spargo shoots on the run from 40 but last-second pressure pushes his shot offline to the left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Langdon throws it on the boot from the wing. It floats high and long&#044; and Fritsch is the best to react&#044; clunking a strong contested mark. On a tough angle&#044; Bayley sneaks it home! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:36)</span><br />
