#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Sweet is pinged for HTB with 30 seconds on the clock. Motlop takes the kick from 40 and misses. The siren goes! Well done&#044; Western Bulldogs. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: The Dogs break quickly from the centre bounce through Bontempelli. Naughton beats Aliir in the one-on-one and seals the deal from 35m out.   <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Cody Weightman roves the pack in the goal square and snaps brilliantly over his head for a vital Bulldogs goal! 3.30 on the clock&#044; 14 points the margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Crozier's kick can't clear the defensive lines. Wines collects and snaps goalward but it drops short where Dixon pops clunks the mark. He slots it with ease â 8 points the margin! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:24)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Johannisen bangs home a long goal from outside 50 to steady the ship for the Dogs. With 12 minutes left&#044; there's still plenty of time here for both teams to write their story. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Marshall sends it from true CHF to the leading Dixon who marks with Keath hot on his heels. Directly in front&#044; 35m out&#044; Charlie sneaks it home. Game on! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Gray snaps from 40 but slips as he kicks. As a result&#044; the footy drops short in the square where Treloar is on the end of an embarrassing nutmeg. ARC checked but the goal stands! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Motlop paddles it in the direction of Fantasia who attempts a soccer kick from 25m that was never online. Minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Libba feeds it out of forward-50 congestion to Treloar whose hasty right-boot snap hits the post.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 24:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Boak sends a bullet of a pass to Georgiades who marks on the chest at full speed. From 25m out on a very tight angle&#044; it's as good a kick as you'll see. Port get one back! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:07)</span><br />
