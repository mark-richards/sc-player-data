#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Demons have nailed eight majors in the final stanza to walk the four points home! 5-0 start for the Dees! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 33:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Spargo sends through a minor score from 35 on the flank&#044; a quick kick out of congestion as the seconds tick down.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 33:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Add another one to the dominant Dees total! Pickett receives a free for high contact and duly converts the snap shot from 30&#044; his second for the day! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gawn gives away the free for high contact in the ruck contest and McEvoy is the recipient.

Classy play ending with the maximum! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Oliver takes the mark on the half-forward flank and has acres ahead unguarded. He waltzes in and is unable to convert from 35 on the flank.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gawn wins the resultant centre clearance and hits the chest of Melksham. The former Bomber shoots from 45 on the slight and slots through another! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Frost makes the error coming out of defence&#044; sending it directly down the throat of former teammate McDonald. Tom moves it wide to the pacing Langdon&#044; who sends it through from 40! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: This time Brown leads Hartigan a merry dance and takes the simple mark. Mitch shoots from 35 on the flank and sends through his second for the minute! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:33)</span><br />
