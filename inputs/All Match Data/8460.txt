#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Durdin chips in front of Charlie Curnow to mark a McKay pass 40m out on the flank for a goal that really did not read the script. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 36:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Walsh reefs out a handball at a stoppage to Silvagni for the goal from 15m to make it a three-figure margin. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 34:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Kennedy lopes free to 55m and bombs a long goal.
