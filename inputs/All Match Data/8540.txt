#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Melbourne get out the back and can pick off marks inside 50&#044; ending with Petracca who fancies another goal. He slots number 4 with seconds remaining on the clock <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Wanganeen-Milera sizes up a kick to Phillipou who marks on the 50m arc. He runs back and gives it everything&#044; but he kicks way out left and hits the behind post <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: 15 point margin with 5 minutes remaining.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Gresham is paid a somewhat dubious mark&#044; but he goes back from 40m out and must kick this goal. He just barely sneaks it home and the Saints continue to hang on! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Brown marks in the pocket and opts for the snap set shot. He kicks it high and bends it back&#044; but it ricochets off the post <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Salem bombs a ball inside 50 and Tom Sparrow is the one who floats in from the side to take a contested mark. He kicks from 40m out and snags his second goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Petracca and Jordon link up out of the middle and get it to the first gamer in Woewodin&#044; he snaps at goal on the run&#044; but the ball just slides past for a point <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Owens bags a goal from the square at ground level after the ball spills to the ground&#044; and the Saints are still in this game! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: A Byrnes fumble causes a turnover on the wing and the Demons punish it with an efficient kick from Brayshaw that finds Melksham. He curls through the set shot and that one hurts. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Sinclair pops up a kick inside 50 where Wood and Caminiti raffle it off. Wood marks 45m out&#044; but again he misses the chance as he slides it out right <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:14)</span><br />
