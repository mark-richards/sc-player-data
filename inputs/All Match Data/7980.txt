#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Carlton break up a GWS attack and counter&#044; moving quickly and easily&#044; with Durdin kicking to Curnow who marks on the 50 directly in front. He misses everything though <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Fisher catches Perryman HTB and gets a shot from 25m out on an angle. He puts it through to bring up the 100 for Carlton as they put GWS to the sword  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Taranto catches Walsh high giving him a set shot from 45m out. He opens the angle and kicks low and strong&#044; but misses left <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Hill injects some pace from the resulting centre bounce&#044; sending it long to Himmelberg who marks in the pocket. He sums up the Giants' night by missing <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: It's party time in Canberra as Docherty has plenty of space to move and fancies himself a goal as he launches from outside 50. He's got the distance and he nails it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Callaghan sends a high kick to the pack inside 50&#044; with Riccardi able to mark in front 20m out. He puts it through and maybe the game isn't over just yet! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: The Giants get it forward but scrap around in desperation&#044; beseeching a goal. Ward finds space for a snap&#044; but misses to the near side <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Carlton surge back forward ending with Silvangi moving into the 50&#044; he sends Haynes off to the Candy shop and jogs another 5 meters before putting the Giants under! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Giants get it forward with Kelly sending a dart to Stone. A crucial kick from 35m out&#044; and Stone misses to the left <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Carlton are well on top here&#044; with Carroll marking 40m out in front. He butchers the kick though&#044; going through for a point <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:21)</span><br />
