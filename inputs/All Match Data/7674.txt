#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Parker's well-weighted pass is to the advantaged side of Franklin. The veteran Swan is able to push off Maynard&#044; clunk the one-hander&#044; and slot the 40m goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Heeney finds himself in the right place at the right time&#044; as Warner's hack kick lands in his lap. On a 45-degree angle&#044; 40m out&#044; Isaac hangs it to the right.   <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Involved in the clearance again&#044; De Goey gets Callum Brown involved whose right-boot snap from 35 is high and wide. That's 1 goal and 6 behinds for Collingwood this quarter. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: De Goey fends off one but is caught by the second. Blakey&#044; the tackler&#044; goes back from 35 and nails it! The fat lady is singing now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Poulter throws in on the left boot from 40m out â it's high and wide&#044; through for a minor score. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Thrust into the middle&#044; De Goey gets the bullocking clearance and links by hand to Callum Brown and Thomas. On the run from 45&#044; the latter misses.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Papley paddles the ball along the boundary line before centering a grubber to Heeney who snaps truly from the hot spot&#044; all but icing the contest. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: De Goey fends off a wimpy tackler at the 30m stoppage&#044; snapping on his right boot but hooking it to the near side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:57)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: A 50m penalty for encroaching brings McLean within range. From about 30m on a slight angle&#044; his attempt bends back but not enough.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: With Quaynor hot on his heels as they stream inside 50&#044; Papley improvises with a mid-air karate kick that narrowly misses.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Buddy flies in and clunks the contested mark just inside the field of play. He opts for the left-foot checkside from the pocket but the ex-Hawk is denied by the woodwork. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:45)</span><br />
