#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Heeney takes a floating pack mark in front of Pearce 40m out on the flank&#044; final siren sounds and he kicks a garbage time special. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Heeney marks at true CHF and goes short to Gulden five metres on&#044; Sydney doing it easy now. Gulden takes his full thirty seconds to kick a point. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Swans now playing tempo&#044; clock nearing 5:00 and Freo no closer. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Technicaly this game is still on with the margin four kicks and 8:45 to play but the Swans have always had an answer so far. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Stanley passes to the lead of Walters 40m out on the flank after Blakey is pinged for deliberate OOB. Sonny swerves it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Gulden with a free at the next bounce&#044; McDonald roves his own contest at the hotspot but snaps just wide right across his body. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Franklin forces Wagner to cough up a handball at CHF&#044; Heeney roves and feeds Mills who kicks over Hughes to Warner 40m out on a slight angle&#044; he seals the deal with his first goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Four kicks in it and 12 minutes to play. Time for another Purple Haze special if this team has it in them. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Schultz somehow gets clear over the back for a Sturt pass to 20m in front. This has to go through for the Dockers... it does. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Erasmus roves a long ball to the Swans hotspot but slips and coughs up the footy under Franklin pressure&#044; McDonald volleys an opportunist goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:19)</span><br />
