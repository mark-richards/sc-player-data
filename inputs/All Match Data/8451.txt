#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Honey's set shot falls short and it's tapped over for a behind  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Acres concedes an unlucky out of bounds call which allows Windhager to line up in the pocket. His snap slams into the post though <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Kennedy gives away a silly 50m penalty that allows Marshall to kick from 55m out. He opens the angle&#044; but hooks it wide in the process <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Silvagni wears a high one from Crouch and gets another free kick deep in the pocket. Silvagni bends it back too early however for a behind <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:59)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Membrey snaps at goal from near 50m out&#044; but it slides across the face for a point <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Wood and Owens combine on the wing&#044; Owens spots a vacant goal-square and smashes a ball in that direction from 55m out&#044; one bounce and it's through for a goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Silvagni receives a free kick for holding as Carlton move out from the middle&#044; A must-kick goal&#044; and Silvagni converts from the pocket! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Wilkie ends up on the forward flank and takes a mark 45m out. A rare chance for the defender&#044; but he sprays it wide <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 29:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: St Kilda are away out of defence and there's acres of space for the forwards to run into. The ball ends up in the hands of Butler who slots his 3rd goal from 35m out in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 25:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Hill kicks cleverly to Higgins and Cordy who are somehow both in space&#044; and it's the small forward who takes the mark. He sneaks this one past the post for a goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 22:32)</span><br />
