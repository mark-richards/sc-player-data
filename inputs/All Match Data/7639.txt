#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: English&#044; Macrae and Bruce as the Doggies will line up for one more post siren. Josh shoots from 35 on the slight and drills the major! Dogs make it 5-0! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Young fists the ball out of the three strong pack and took everyone in his wake.

The Suns captain shoots on the slight and misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ainsworth is the next one to line up for goal as the intensity has clearly dropped out of this one. Ben shoots from 35 on the flank&#044; missing to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dale thuds an effort to the hot spot. Bontempelli appears the target&#044; but Bruce is the one to skid in out the back and take the mark. He misses from 40 on the flank. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Scott flies over the top of Ellis and clunks the grab. Anthony Scott sends through the home sides sixteenth of the day&#044; finishing truly from 30 out&#044; directly in front!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: McNeil&#044; Smith and Bailey bounds his full measure before hitting Naughton out the back. Aaron lines up after clunking in the square and ceils the deal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Macrae&#044; Liberatore and Smith combine as the Bulldogs search for their next scoring opportunity. Bailey unleashes with an inside out drop punt&#044; missing to the near side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Treloar has the ball at half forward and sends it in scoring range&#044; to the advantage of Smith who takes the mark. Bailey shoots from 45 on the flank and misses to the far side. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bontempelli reads the ball off the Bruce contest. He wades in and out of congestion&#044; flicking wide to the eager Liberatore. Tom receives and sends it through from 45! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:51)</span><br />
