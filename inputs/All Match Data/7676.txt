#####<em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Robinson throws it on the boot from the centre square&#044; landing in the lap of Hipwood. Eric goes back from 45&#044; shoots&#044; and misses. There's the final siren! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Birchall pops it up to the hot spot where Daniher earns the free for being held. Directly in front&#044; Joe opts for the snap and nails it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hipwood eyes the big sticks from 45 but his shot is high and wide.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Ainsworth lines up from 30m on a tight angle and sneaks it in! Believe it or not&#044; that's four on the trot for Gold Coast. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Greenwood crumbs the contest at the 35 and snaps classily on the outside of his left boot to make it three in a row for the Suns. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: After Atkins sends it forward&#044; King leaps and marks strongly in front of Andrews&#044; kicking truly from 20m out&#044; directly in front. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: High contact against Starcevich gifts Flanders a look at goal from 50m out. On a 45-degree angle&#044; he sends a long&#044; strong shot that finally gets the Suns' scoreboard ticking over. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Hipwood centres the footy from the boundary where Zorko crumbs the pack and snaps truly. That makes it 14 goals in a row for the Lions. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Bailey sends a low bullet forward from outside 50 that skids on through the goals. Umpire's call is a goal&#044; and following the ARC review&#044; that's how it stays.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Anderson's corridor kick sets up Flanders who handballs into the path of the running Ainsworth. Ben has time to steady but can't keep the shot online.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Evan_Bryce</em>: Lyons spears the pass to the leading Daniher&#044; right on the paint. He kicks from 55&#044; the ball swirls in the air and is eventually punched over the line. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:19)</span><br />
