#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Pittonet feeds Martin who blazes wide left from 45m on a slight angle just before the final siren. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 33:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Adams marks a Sidebottom snap on the behind line for a garbage time special in the last minute. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Nick Daicos baulks around McGovern on the HFF and draws some ironic cheers from the Carlton faithful with a shank across the face and OOTF from 40m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Weitering touches through a Nick Daicos snap from half forward. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Enough time has elapsed now that Carlton are secure with the win. Just too many squandered chances by the Pies in a reasonably tight contest. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hewett feeds Acres behind a stoppage 45m out on the flank&#044; his left-foot snap under pressure wobbles wide. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Kemp turns the ball over by foot at half back&#044; Elliott goes to Howe on the boundary 25m out&#044; he plays on and kicks goal number three for the quarter! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Blocking free in ruck on McStay&#044; De Koning goes long to the hotspot&#044; blocking free on Moore to Curnow&#044; sixth goal to the Egyptian. Blues are just about home now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hewett's kick goes nowhere from the next bounce under a tackle&#044; Nick Daicos volleys it for Howe to dive and mark 45m out in front&#044; he converts again.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Howe marks in front of Dow 15m out and makes no mistake. Five kicks and 11 minutes to go. This would be the biggest thievery of all if the Maggies get up from here. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:25)</span><br />
