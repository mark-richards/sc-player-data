#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: 7 seconds left on the clock! 1 point in it now! Last chance for the Tigers from the centre bounce! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Essendon work it inside 50. It goes to ground and Stringer is there in the pocket. He squares it up and Durham MARKS IN THE SQUARE! He milks the clock&#044; he runs in and kicks! GOAL! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Cotchin gathers and spears a short one inside to Mansell who marks 35m out. A big moment on a big stage&#044; and he misses everything! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: McDonald-Tipungwuti snaps from the pocket looking for a miracle&#044; but finds a behind instead <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Essendon get loose out the back and Davey pumps it inside 50. It's a footrace&#044; 3v3. Balta overshoots it and Durham gathers the loose ball&#044; to Langford&#044; to Menzie! GOAL BOMBERS! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Martin kicks towards a vacant goalsquare&#044; Redman and Clarke give chase&#044; with the former believing he'd rushed it over. It stays in however&#044; and Clarke just pokes it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Draper and Merrett combine out of the middle to get it to Stringer. He has space ahead so runs to 55m out and the Package delivers when he needed to! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Merrett marks in the middle of the ground and sets off instantly&#044; spotting Durham out wide by himself. He stands tall to mark and converts a big goal for the Bombers! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Dustin Martin marks on the 50m arc. He opens the angle and just barely gets it home to extend the margin to 3 goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Martin gets a short away as the siren sounds&#044; but Hind rushes back to get a hand on it and force a rushed behind <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(3 Qtr Time)</span><br />
