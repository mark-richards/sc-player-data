#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Adams attempts a late shot on goal with seconds remaining but it flies wide <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Rioli kicks from the half forward flank to an unopposed Bolton who pulls down the mark. He runs around and adds the finishing touch to a great Richmond performance! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Maurice Rioli invents a clever tap to Martin who chips to Castagna marking 35m out in front. His kick is an absolute shank&#044; and there's no resulting score <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Henry flies from the side of the pack to take an impressive pack mark 35m out on a slight angle. He kicks truly and the Pies keep piling on the late goals <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Crisp dishes off to Daicos who streams into the 50 and takes a shot&#044; but he misses  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Mihocek marks on the wing and sends it to the pack where Hoskin-Elliot rises above everybody to take an impressive hanger in the wet! The mark deserves a goal and it gets one! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:08)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Mihocek and Lipinski chain the handballs to Adams who goes from 45m out on the run and gets a late goal for Collingwood <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:34)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: McCreery slices a kick down to Ginnivan who marks 25m out with no angle. He persists with the run around kick and makes no mistake for his third goal to the boos of the Tiger fans <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Maurice Rioli is the playmaker once more spotting Dusty in the pocket who then marks&#044; plays on and gets called back before running around again and kicks his second goal <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: The ruckmen combine as Begg hits up Cameron inside 50&#044; who in turn hits up Sidebottom running in from the wing. Sidebottom marks 35m out and kicks quickly but misses <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:42)</span><br />
