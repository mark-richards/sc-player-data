#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Smith has a lash from 50m on the flank but that's wide&#044; Saints are home. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Ah but it's ruled OOB off Hawkins&#044; stoppage deep in attack for Geelong... Billings to Hill for the rebound... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 50 seconds on the restart&#044; that should be enough. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Close hits Narkle on the fat side wing with a long kick&#044; Narkle fumbles but has time to butter up and pass to Cameron 45m out on a slight angle&#044; kick is short and rushed. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Tuohy bombs long to the centre from the kick in but there are a host of Saints to mop it up and play some tempo&#044; clock under 3:00. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Billings marks 45m out on a slight angle despite a late lunge by Selwood.&#044; he also misses with 3:36 to go.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Five minute warning on the kick in&#044; anyone's game. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Stewart drops an intercept mark on the HBF&#044; Membrey roves and feeds Gresham who kicks over Duncan to Wood near the hotspot. This would just about be the sealer... no good. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 7:34 to go and Cats only two kicks behind. It's a grind from here&#044; two good sides duking it out to the last bell. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Cameron marks a short Duncan pass just inside 50m on a slight angle in front of Hill. His kick flirts with the right goalpost but falls in! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:07)</span><br />
