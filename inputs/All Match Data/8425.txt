#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 3:49 to go and still four kicks in it&#044; too late for the Cats unless something stupid happens. They haven't played nearly well enough to deserve to pinch it either. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Dangerfield kicks long from half forward to the square where Rohan outmarks Farrar for his second goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Lukosius marks in the pocket 30m out and checksides through his fifth goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Lukosius passes inside 50 to Jeffrey who drops a sitter but Homlan roves and goes to the square where Sexton marks and goals&#044; Gold Coast is home! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Lukosius intercepts a dump kick by Bruhn to 55m in front. He points to the goals&#044; then runs in and bangs through his fourth goal! Babe Ruth areas&#044; home run! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Lukosius kicks long from outer wing to the flank 45m out&#044; King has the sit on Ratugolea and takes a massive screamer! Now for the finish... just wide right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Rohan mows down Macpherson to win a HTB free 40m out on a slight angle. He boots a big goal&#044; his first. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Jeffrey kicks high and rather hopeful to 40m on a slight angle but Casboult is one out with Tuohy and beats him easily to mark.... but then miss. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: A rare moment of finishing quality by a backman&#044; it's been a funny old day at Carrara. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:10)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Ballard beats Hawkins to intercept a high Atkins rebound kick to 45m on a slight angle. Ballard roosts a huge goal&#044; that's going to put the cat amongst the chickens! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:30)</span><br />
