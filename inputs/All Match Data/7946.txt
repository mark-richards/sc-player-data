#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Saints finally bust out of a stoppage on the slingshot&#044; Higgins marks 25m out and gives Crouch a Joe the Goose special for the sealer. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Coniglio receives a handball deep on the pocket 25m out and tries a checkside off a step&#044; he shaves the goalpost with Whitfield inboard waving his arms. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:56)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Stoppage after stoppage in midfield but no GWS breakaways. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 4:32 and two straight kicks in it. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Ross mops up a dump kick by Whitfield and passes across half forward to the flank 45m out for Gresham. This would ice it... across the face. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:02)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Kennedy marks the kick in and goes to the pocket 25m out where Flynn marks then plays on with a handball to Himmelberg who misses badly. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:55)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Ward roves a Stein contest and tries a Daicos special from the boundary 15m out but it skids into the post. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: King uses all his height to mark a high Higgins kick to the pocket 35m out. Now comes the hard part&#044; from a tough angle... just misses right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: GWS rewarded for a lot of territory in the last five minutes&#044; Saints are flooding back so it's hard work scoring. Maybe some centre clearances might decide this one. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Whitfield roves and goes long from a stoppage on the wing&#044; Paton receives from Lienert but gets claimed HTB by Himmelberg 15m out for the goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:24)</span><br />
