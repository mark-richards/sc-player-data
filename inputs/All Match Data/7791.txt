#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: First draw between these two sides&#044; playing each other since 1925.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The final siren sounds and the game ends a draw&#044; Richmond kicking the last five of the contest to share the spoils.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Riewoldt soccers through from the top of the square and the game will be a tie! A huge pack converged and Jack sent it through with an opportunistic half-volley! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 33:40)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hawks lead by one straight kick. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: 34 seconds left to play from the centre bounce.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Riewoldt takes the strong mark out on the boundary following the Graham pass. Jack lines up from the sharp angle&#044; 35 out&#044; and sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 31:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bramble runs too far from the kick-in and the free is paid to Lynch. Lachie then abuses the umpire&#044; resulting in a 50-metre penalty. Tom nabs his third! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Make that two in a minute for Stack! Scrimshaw drops the mark going back with the flight&#044; Bolton swoops and swings it to the pocket.

Sydney makes no mistake from 25 out&#044; directly in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Brockman takes the mark out ahead of Vlastuin and flicks wide to the run of Scrimshaw. Jack settles on the shot and hammers it through from 35 on the left peg! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:22)</span><br />
