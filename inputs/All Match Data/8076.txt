He runs in from 25m out&#044; and with accuracy better than Shai Bolton&#044; puts it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Butler pokes a ball through to Windhager who has plenty of space 40m out in front. His kick is a bad one as it sticks to the right though in a dirty second half for St Kilda <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Higgins cleans up a spilled ball from a very rare foray inside 50 for the Sainters&#044; he snaps around the body and slots a goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:04)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Menegola wins a free kick against Ross directly in front 15m out&#044; and casually puts another nail in the St Kilda coffin <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:07)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Cameron pops a little dinky kick out in front of Hawkins but Close jumps on it and dashes towards goal&#044; as he gets in on the act! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Cameron marks 40m out on the boundary and lines up his favoured snap set shot. He curls it back to perfection and Jezza has two as he looks to junk it up! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Hawkins shovels a handball out to Menegola who kicks from 45 out&#044; but his kick is to the left for a point <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 4:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Geelong move forward through a raking Holmes kick that finds the pack and spills to ground&#044; Miers is there to crumb and goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:18)</span><br />
