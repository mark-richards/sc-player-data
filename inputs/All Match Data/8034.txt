#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Lewis gets a free kick 30m out on the boundary and as the clock hits zero Lewis screws through a behind to make the margin 22 points.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Shiels slides in to take a good mark 35m out in front. He puts it through for some late Hawthorn joy <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Haynes lines up for a late sniff at goal&#044; but kicks across the face and it's rushed through <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:41)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Lloyd cleans up the loose ball and kicks backwards to Ash who marks on the 50. He soaks up some time and kicks long and high&#044; but ultimately off target <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Brown kicks to Greene but it gets out the back and Haynes is unable to scoop it up as it rolls through for a behind <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Bramble drops it in the middle of the ground and in the resulting play Kelly takes us back to 2009 with a toe poke off the ground which finds its way to Hogan out the back. Goal! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Hogan kicks towards Brown and Impey takes him out of the contest&#044; resulting in a free kick 35m out on an angle. The sharpshooter in the wet makes it four! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 3:29)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Greene takes a diving mark on the 50 with little angle and gives it everything&#044; but it skews to the left as a result for a behind to start the final quarter  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Taranto catches Moore high as he goes after the ball&#044; and he lines up from 45m out on a slight angle. The dynamic small forward gets it done for Hawthorn on the verge of 3QT! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 30:39)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: It's a mess as Cumming launches a ball to the top of the square&#044; in the resulting scramble Wehr is able to get a kick off while on his back&#044; and kick a goal! Incredible! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 27:59)</span><br />
