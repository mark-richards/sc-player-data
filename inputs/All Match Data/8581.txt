#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Murphy is unlucky to be pinged for contact on Henry 35m out just before the final siren&#044; Collingwood fans clear their throats to boo the set shot&#044; which is a goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:53)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Jeremy Cameron rolls through goal number seven to make it three goals the difference with 4:03 to play. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Neale marks 25m out on the flank and shoots across the face. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Dangerfield passes to Henry deep in the pocket 20m out&#044; desultory boos then he snaps his third goal.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Jeremy Cameron gets an arm chop free on Frampton leading to 45m on the flank. Jezza's set shot drop punts have been poor in recent weeks... short and rushed. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Howe misses McCreery on a fast break to the pocket but the Pie gathers and beats Holmes to centre for Mihocek 15m out&#044; Checkers makes it checkmate with that goal. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Henry pokes a tiny pass inside to Parfitt who has a moment to sum up the situation from 20m in the pocket... and chooses to curl it OOTF. Oh dear. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Geelong have been gallant&#044; but the Pies need just one more goal to ice it from here. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Adams grubbers a snap off a step from 35m on the flank but it skids across the face. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Ratugolea drops the Tuohy kick in 40m out&#044; Pies everywhere&#044; McCreery snaps truly around the corner. Too many mistakes by the Cats. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:51)</span><br />
