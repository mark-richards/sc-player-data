#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Gardiner shanks a short kick right to a Richmond player&#044; he chips it over the top to Lynch who marks 20m out right in front.

He nails the kick and Richmond are in front!!! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Lynch takes a specky on the 50&#044; gives it a proper roost from 55&#044; but the ball glances off the post cruelly at the finish! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Mathieson takes a shot at goal&#044; but it rolls through for a point  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:51)</span><br />
