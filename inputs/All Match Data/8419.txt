#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Liberatore passes to Ugle-Hagan who had been left alone at the hotspot&#044; siren sounds and he lines up for number five... take that nuffies! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Richards intercepts the speculative kick in to the centre and the Dogs are home&#044; tempo footy now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Coleman roves on the HBF but Naughton catches him HTB&#044; red hot decision that one. Naughton drains the clock by lining up for goal&#044; his kick is short and rushed. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Wilmot intercepts the rebound kick after that kick in and goes long to the pocket but English marks in relief. 2:30 to go&#044; it's the Bulldogs' game to lose now. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Answerth feeds Neale for a flying snap from 45m on a slight angle... across the face. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Bontempelli engineers a clearance from the wing&#044; Naughton takes a big pack mark on the HFF and goes quick to the square where Williams marks in front of Ashcroft and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: 5:11 to go and the Lions are a kick behind. The margin has been thereabouts ever since the Dogs put on three in a row in Q2.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Scott gives away 50m at half back for timewasting&#044; Andrews goes quickly to the pocket where Bruce is out of position and concedes a free to Hipwood 20m out. The Eel goals. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:17)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Daniel feeds Williams for a long snap from the HFF that flies wide left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:32)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Botrh sides have overloaded the midfield with bodies zoming up from the flanks and left spares in defence. That is a recipe for the low scoring in this one. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:18)</span><br />
