#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Pendlebury goes to the leading Grundy and Brodie receives the free-kick for holding against the undersized Collins. He shoots and goals from 30 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:19)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mihocek takes a strong mark at the top of the square with less than five minutes left to play. Kicking for his fourth of the afternoon&#044; he finishes truly from close range! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:25)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mihocek to Brown as the Pies have a rare foray in the attacking arc. Callum has the time to settle and finish from 25&#044; but misses poorly to the right-hand side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:54)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Farrar floats the pill up and Corbett pulls down a contested grab&#044; with relative ease as the Pies ease up. Josh shoots from 40 on the flank&#044; missing to the near side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:58)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Crisp is caught by the desperate Anderson chase&#044; enabling Holman to dab inside the arc and find Corbett. Josh marks and sends through his fourth from 50! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Suns swing it to the other end of the ground and Weller finds Greenwood out the back. The Pies are apathetic&#044; allowing Hugh to flick to Corbett on the goal line for another! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Quaynor moves it wide and they work it forward through Noble to the isolated De Goey/Lemmens contest. Jordan receives the free for an illegal bump and resultantly misses from 35.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 6:11)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Corbett's straight kick brings up the largest margin of the afternoon. All for the Pies to do in this last stanza! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Mayne catches Corbett by the arm and Josh has the opportunity to send through the first of the fourth. He shoots from 40 on the slight and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 1:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Suns keep finding ways to mark out the back of a scrambled Pies defence&#044; this time through Greenwood. The former Crow marks over Keane and finishes truly from 30! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 26:47)</span><br />
