#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Bombers win in a canter&#044; Suns barely firing a shot after quarter-time.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Merrett waltzes through the corridor and finds Smith unguarded. The former Giant takes the mark and sends the shot wide from 45 on the flank.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:33)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Redman catches Townsend high in the attempted tackle and the free is duly awarded. The former premiership player lines up from 30 on the slight and sends it through! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 12:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Wright&#044; Stringer&#044; McGrath and Redman all combine across the half-forward flank before Mason assesses the options and finds Durham on the lead. Sam marks and hits the post from 35.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Clarke finds some space within the attacking arc and Hind finds him with a well-weighted low punt. Dylan takes the uncontested mark and strokes home from 35 on the slight! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 5:05)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Francis launches long to the hot spot. Wright converges on the drop zone and flies above all else&#044; but fails to catch. Stringer duly crumbs with class&#044; settles and goals from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 2:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Lemmens makes illegal contact in the marking contest and Smith duly received the free-kick. Shooting post siren&#044; Devon hammers home another from 50 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 27:03)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: MacPherson is wrangled in the tackle&#044; coughing up possession for Hind to swoop. The former Saint runs his measure&#044; and thumps it through from 40 out on the slight angle! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 19:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Devon Smith receives at half-forward and has the time to amble up&#044; walking at one point&#044; before centring. Parish eventually gets on the end of it&#044; missing from 45 to the left.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 12:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Corbett is fed out the back and Gold Coast have a clear opportunity with little pressure around him. However&#044; Josh is unaware of the circumstances&#044; missing poorly from 25.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q3 10:47)</span><br />
