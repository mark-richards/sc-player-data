#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Hawkins dives to suck a high contact free on Wines after a stoppage 50m out on a slight angle&#044; he kicks a dagger of a goal to a chorus of boos. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Close kicks over Clurey to Hawkins in the pocket 10m out&#044; this set shot is like shelling peas for the Tomahawk&#044; he converts. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Cam Guthrie mows down a lumbering Aliir 40m out on the flank&#044; he gives off to Duncan who misses&#044; 94 each of two. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Powell-Pepper tumbles a snap wide from a stoppage near the hotspot&#044; Port leads by that point. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:36)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Powell-Pepper spoils a Tuohy kick across half back&#044; mad scramble&#044; Marshall baulks clear and centres for Amon 45m out in front.
