#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Wines coughs it up cheaply to Jordon who marks 50m out and milks the time off the clock&#044; but can't make the distance  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 29:01)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Port go forward again&#044; this time Drew is the one lining up a kick. Drew goes from 45m out on a decent angle&#044; and flushes it! 13 points with 3 minutes left! It's not ever yet! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 25:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Boak kicks goalward from the forward flank&#044; it swings back beautifully&#044; and Marshall marks on the line to prevent an interception&#044; and goals! Port couldn't do it could they? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Powell-Pepper tries to get himself a goal late&#044; but once again can't kick truly&#044; this time hitting the behind post <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:00)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Port get some good link-up play going with Wines&#044; Rozee and Boak combining. Wines eventually handballs back to Boak who runs to 30m out and puts through some consolation  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:21)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Petracca spies Kozzy in the pocket and hits him up&#044; he goes for the run around snap on his set shot&#044; and kicks his sixth! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 17:45)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: It's turned over in the middle and the Dees surge&#044; Kozzy collects the loose ball and runs to 50&#044; kicking from just outside&#044; it rolls through the goal to cap off Kozzy's day! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 14:20)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Drew is rewarded a high free kick&#044; and while everyone is napping chips it to Wines. Ollie kicks from 45m out on a slight angle&#044; but the Brownlow medallist can't convert <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:35)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Melksham gets the ball in the pocket&#044; and spots Brown all by himself 20m out in front. Brown marks on the chest&#044; starts his routine&#044; runs in and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Powell-Pepper tries his luck with a running shot&#044; but it bounces into the post <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:45)</span><br />
