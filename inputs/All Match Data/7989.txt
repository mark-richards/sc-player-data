#####<em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Zorko gets a very late goal on the run to cut the margin back to 5 points but with 2 seconds left on the clock it won't be enough... Will it? <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 36:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: McInerney gets a free kick 55m out&#044; he dishes off to Rich who sends it to the pack but no one can mark! Bailey tries to invent something but is pinged HTB and that's the game! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 35:44)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: The Lions move forward quickly through Neale who sends a chiseller to Cameron&#044; the ball pings around and Cameron gets it back&#044; he does the dribble kick and misses! 11 point margin! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 34:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Jack Payne gets a set shot from 45m out on the boundary&#044; the unlikely forward makes it look easy and cuts the margin down to 2 goals with 100 seconds remaining! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 33:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: A pause in play as Lynch is assisted from the ground. 3 minutes&#044; 3 goal lead. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: The Hawks rush forward from defence and Breust has plenty of time to find an option but can only centre it. The ball spills and is rushed through by Andrews. 3 goal game. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Newcombe runs from the centre bounce once again and drills it long&#044; the ball spills&#044; Lewis gets it to Butler&#044; and Butler kicks it into the post! 17 point lead with 7 minutes left <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:50)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Zorko goes for a run to bring it out of the defensive 50&#044; but runs just a bit too far and Lewis gets a set shot 50m out on an angle. Lewis hammers it through and they lead by 16!  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 23:30)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Hawthorn get a 50m penalty that brings them to the middle of the ground. Koschitzke marks the resulting entry 45m out on a slight angle. He gives it everything but it's rushed over <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Urbs</em>: Hipwood finds himself in space and tries to snap a goal but he just kind of kicks it high and out of bounds on the full <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:31)</span><br />
