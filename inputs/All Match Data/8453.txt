#####<em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Cotchin sets up Martin for a junk time goal on the bounce from 40m. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:15)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Van Rooyen takes another contested grab from a Petracca kick in front of Grimes at the hotspot. This for three for the quarter... it's good! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: David Rodan called it a goal&#044; review can't see through Van Rooyen's big frame so it stays a goal despite a strong case that the boot touch was over the line.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:47)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Or does he? Score review... <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:16)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Mansell bumps Viney after disposal inside 50&#044; bit soft but the free was there. Pickett takes it 40m out on the boundary... falls on the goal line where Gawn goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:49)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Rivers intercepts Hopper in the back pocket but Baker picks off his rebound kick to 40m on the flank. Then he misses. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 16:18)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Vlastuin bombs long to a big pack near the hotspot where Grundy falls in front to allow Ryan to mark again. This has to go through for Richmond... wide right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 13:31)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Taranto feeds a rampaging Martin who reaches true CHF and snaps... the old Dusty would have nailed that but this one is wide right. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 11:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Van Rooyen takes another contested grab in a pack 30m out on the other flank&#044; he has come from nowhere in Q4! Goal umpire David Rodan crabs sideways... then puts up two fingers! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 8:46)</span><br /><em style='color:#d00'>m0nty</em>: Young is pinged for an arm hold on Van Rooyen at much the same spot as the last set shot. The crowd hoots ROO but he misses that one. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 7:06)</span><br />
