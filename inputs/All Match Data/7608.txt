#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Saints victors by 8 points in an epic to start the season! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Full Time)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Saints are home! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:38)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ward is caught holding the ball and Butler receives the free-kick. Less than 50 seconds to play. The former Tiger shoots from 40 and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Boundary throw-in&#044; neutral territory. 2:00 left to play. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 30:27)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Saints lead by 2 points. 3:22 left. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 28:12)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Gresham manhandles Davis and pounces on the loose pill. Jade flicks wide to the pacing Sinclair&#044; Jack unable to split the difference from the pocket. <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:42)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Giants surge forward&#044; initially with the Greene handball. Keefe takes the mark out on the lead via the Hopper pass. The former Magpie hammers it through from 45 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 26:43)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Membrey gets ahead of Taylor and Tim takes the seemingly uncontested mark. St Kilda lines up for their third straight goal and Tim banks it! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 22:23)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ross takes the intercept mark across the half-forward flank and has a congested forward 50 to pass in. He runs his measure&#044; foregoes the passing duties and goals from 50! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 21:13)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: An incredible Lonie effort has the Saints grabbing a major against the run of play. Pegged up against the boundary line&#044; 25 out&#044; Jack thunders it through off the left peg! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:27)</span><br />
