#####<em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Fogarty launches to the isolated Walker/Schache matchup and Taylor takes the lead-up grab against the Bulldog. He lines up and converts truly from 30 out&#044; directly in front! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 32:48)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Make that twelve individual goalkickers for the home side! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: English takes the contested mark across half-forward&#044; but an off the ball free kick on Weightman is paid further afield. Cody accepts the gift with glee from 25! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 27:28)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith turns it over with an errant handball&#044; smothered by Scott and gathered by Bontempelli. He thrusts off Brodie&#044; settles on the left and hammers it home from 40! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 24:22)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Fogarty bests Wood in the one-on-one&#044; pushing off Easton and taking the lead up grab. Shooting from 40 on the flank&#044; Darcy sends his effort into the post.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 20:51)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Dunkley released the pacing Dale by hand&#044; enabling Bailey to run and thump his effort to the mouth of goal. One bounce is all it takes for the classy half-back! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 19:26)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Smith dabs out to the leading Ugle-Hagan&#044; Jamarra marking out ahead of Murray. The youngster sends his shot well wide&#044; but Hannan takes the mark. Mitch misses from the pocket.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 18:14)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Ugle-Hagan wins the pill out of the heat of battle&#044; flinging his effort from 40 on the flank to the near side.  <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 15:37)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: Hunter is found unguarded in scoring range&#044; via the sublime foot skills of Dale. Lachie marks&#044; shoots and sends it through from 35 on the flank! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 10:52)</span><br /><em style='color:#069'>Ben_Gogos</em>: The Crows have two in a minute! From the resultant centre stoppage&#044; Sloane thuds it to the hot spot. The ball is worked wide to Murphy&#044; Lachlan settles on the left peg and goals! <span class='team' style='color:#888'>(Q4 9:27)</span><br />
